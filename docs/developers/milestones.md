# Milestones

Milestones serve as significant checkpoints or stages of progress within the project timeline. They represent our
key accomplishments that mark important progress towards achieving the project's goals. Each
milestone signifies the completion of a specific phase or the achievement of a significant goal.

## Working Prototype

At this stage, we implemented the core functionality of the product. The prototype demonstrates
the basic features and functionalities expected in the final product. It may lack polish and may contain bugs, but it
serves as a demonstration of the product concept.

## Working Product

This milestone marks the completion of the development phase. The product is functional and meets the
specified requirements. It has undergone testing to ensure reliability, usability, and performance. The user
interface (UI) and user experience (UX) elements are refined, providing a seamless interaction for end-users. While
there may still be minor issues to address, the product is ready for deployment and use by customers.

## Final touches

In this phase, we focus on adding finishing touches to the product to enhance its quality and user
experience further. This may include addressing any remaining bugs or issues identified during testing, optimizing
performance and refining the UI/UX based on user feedback.
The goal is to polish the product and make it as robust and user-friendly as possible before its official release.
