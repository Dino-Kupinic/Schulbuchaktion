You should also configure these settings:

| Setting        | Value                 |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Indentation    | 2                     |
| Double Quotes  | Always                |
| Trailing Comma | Always when multiline |
| Semicolon      | Never (TypeScript)    |

In TypeScript, prefer arrow functions and `async/await` syntax.
