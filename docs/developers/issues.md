# Issues

Features, enhancement requests, and bug reports are done via GitHub issues. Every issue gets ranked on the following
labels:

## Levels

A level describes the urgency of the issue, while level 1 often includes boring stuff like installing something or
fixing a typo, level 5 should be done immediately.

::: info Level 1 -> "chore"
These are tasks that should be done when there is nothing else to do. They are typically routine or mundane tasks that
contribute to the smooth functioning of daily life or work. While not urgent or critical, they still require attention
to maintain efficiency and organization.
:::

::: tip Level 2 -> "nice to have"
These tasks are considered optional and can be added when there is available time. They often enhance the quality or
convenience of a situation but are not essential for immediate completion. Level 2 tasks can include activities that
improve efficiency, enhance aesthetics, or provide additional features.
:::

::: warning Level 3 -> "fix when possible"
This level indicates issues or problems that should be addressed but are not considered critical. They can be deferred
until higher priority tasks are completed, but they should not be ignored indefinitely. Level 3 tasks may include minor
bugs, usability improvements, or non-essential repairs.
:::

::: danger Level 4 -> "important"
Tasks at this level are significant and require attention. They are essential for maintaining operations, meeting
objectives, or preventing further problems. While not urgent, they should be prioritized and addressed in a timely
manner to prevent escalation or negative consequences.
:::

::: danger Level 5 -> "urgent"
These tasks require immediate action due to their critical nature or time sensitivity. They often involve emergencies,
safety concerns, or situations where delays can result in significant negative impacts. Level 5 tasks should be
prioritized above all others and addressed as quickly as possible to mitigate risks or resolve urgent issues.

## Workflow

A developer chooses to take on an issue, creates a branch where they will only work on the task, and then they create a
pull request. After successful merging, he repeats the process.
